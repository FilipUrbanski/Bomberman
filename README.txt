HOW TO RUN:
1.  Interpreter used: Python 3.10
2.  Import PyQt5
3.  Create resources_rc.py file by typing 'pyrcc5 resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py' into terminal
4.  Compile and in console choose Zoom and Grid size (You will be required to type the same values twice).
    For the best experience I'd recommend 800, 1600 or 3200 zoom with 20, 40 or 80 grid.

GAMEPLAY:
1.  Move with arrow keys and place bombs with space
2.  Some obstacles can be destroyed with one bomb some with two
3.  You can kill enemies with bombs
4.  BE CAREFUL if enemy touches you the game ends

WHAT WORKS:
1.  QGraphicsScene (1 pkt.)
2.  QGraphicsItem Inheritance (1 pkt.)
3.  Keyboard movement (1 pkt.)
4.  External graphics from .qrc file (resource file) (1 pkt.)
5.  One type of enemy - static (1 / 3 pkt.???)
6.  Randomized board with passing through borders (2 / 2 pkt.)
7.  Three types of obstacles (3 / 3 pkt.)

Total : 9 / 15
Total I would give myself : 8 or 9 points depending on if you count unfinished enemies as 0 or 1 point.
